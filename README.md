# Node-Typescript-Starter-Template

⚡ The basic template to start a node typescript based project with colde reloading and some linting styles (shopify and eslint) configured ⚡

## Installation

Clone the repo either using SSH or HTTPS and run either of the command below (I prefer yarn - no hard feelings 👍) to install dependencies:

```
yarn
```
or

```
npm install
```

## Locally

To start the project run:

```
yarn start:dev
```

or

```
npm run start:dev
```

Be consistent though...😎

## Checking for config errors

Run:

```
yarn lint
```

or

```
npm run lint
```

## Fixing these errors

Do...

```
yarn lint:fix
```

or

```
npm run lint:fix
```

## Shoutout

My biggest shoutout goes to [@stemmlerjs](https://twitter.com/stemmlerjs) and others who have helped me on this journey.

I can't but appreciate my wife's support and our children for their patience in the wake to be a world class software engineer.
